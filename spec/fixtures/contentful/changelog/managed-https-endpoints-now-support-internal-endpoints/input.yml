:body: "We’re happy to announce that [Managed HTTPS](https://www.aptible.com/blog/managed-https/)
  is now available on Enclave for Internal Endpoints (in addition to External Endpoints,
  which were supported from day 1).\n\nThis means your internal-facing apps can now
  enjoy the benefits of Managed HTTPS Endpoints:\n\n- Automated certificate provisioning\n-
  Automated certificate renewals\n- Monitoring to detect problems with renewals and
  alert you\n\n\n### Getting Started\nWhen you create a __new Managed HTTPS Endpoint__,
  the Aptible Dashboard will indicate which CNAME records you need to create via your
  DNS provider in order for Enclave to provision and renew certificates on your behalf
  (you’ll see one record for internal Endpoints, and two for external Endpoints —
  read on to understand why):\n\n![Configure Existing Endpoint for Managed HTTPS](//images.contentful.com/8djp5jlzqrnc/59C4fZSI2AoEeQI0M0oCs6/41cec0b8467b3efd78936cb8eafad54c/image01.png)\n\nFor
  __existing Managed HTTPS Endpoints__, the Dashboard lets you review your current
  DNS configuration, so you can easily review whether everything is configured properly:\n\n![Configure
  New Endpoint for Managed HTTPS](//images.contentful.com/8djp5jlzqrnc/2CLaBK7Ec0wie4OC8aMUoC/7eac92b25d583df696c0e919d476d6b8/image00.png)\n\nIf
  your Endpoint DNS records are misconfigured and Enclave is unable to automatically
  renew the certificate, Aptible support staff will contact you.\n\n\n### How it works\nFundamentally,
  Managed HTTPS relies on <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org?utm_campaign=aptible\"
  target=\"_blank\">Let’s Encrypt</a> to provision and renew certificates from your
  apps. Let’s Encrypt offers multiple ways to verify control of a domain, but they
  all boil down to the same process:\n- We notify Let’s Encrypt that we’d like to
  provision a new certificate for your domain\n- Let’s Encrypt provides us with a
  set of challenges to try and prove we control the domain\n- We fulfill one of the
  challenges, and get the certificate\n\n\nThere’s a total of 3 types of challenges
  supported in Let’s Encrypt, and we now use 2 of them:\n\n#### HTTP Challenges\nFor
  HTTP challenges, Let’s Encrypt provides us with an arbitrary token and a URL under
  the domain we’re attempting to verify, and expects us to serve the token when it
  makes a request to that URL.\n\nThe token is a random string of data, and the URL
  looks like this:\n\n`http://$YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/acme-challenge/$SOME_RANDOM_STRING`\n\nWe’ve
  supported HTTP challenges since day one: when Let’s Encrypt makes its request to
  your app hosted on Enclave (i.e. assuming you created a `CNAME` from `$YOUR_DOMAIN`
  to your Enclave Endpoint), Enclave intercepts the requests, serves the token, and
  thus validates control of the domain.\n\n\nObviously, this only works if Let’s Encrypt
  can connect to your domain from the Internet. This becomes a problem for Internal
  Endpoints or Endpoints with [IP Filtering](https://www.aptible.com/blog/ip-filtering-made-easy-with-enclave-endpoints/),
  since Let’s Encrypt can’t connect to them!\n\n\nThat’s why we’ve now added support
  for DNS Challenges as well.\n\n#### DNS Challenges\nDNS challenges are comparatively
  simpler than HTTP challenges. Here again, Let’s Encrypt provides an arbitrary token,
  but this time we’re expected to serve that token as a TXT record in DNS under the
  following name:\n\n`_acme-challenge.$YOUR_DOMAIN.`\n\n\nNow, there’s one little
  hiccup here: we don’t control `_acme-challenge.$YOUR_DOMAIN`: you do! To make this
  work, you need to tell Let’s Encrypt that you trust us to provision and renew certificates
  on your behalf.\n\n\nTo do so, you simply need to create a CNAME via your DNS provider
  from that record Let’s Encrypt is interested in to another record controlled by
  Enclave. To make this easy for you, the Dashboard will instruct you to do so, and
  give you the exact record to create.\n\n\nAnd of course, the upside of using a DNS
  challenge is that unlike a HTTP challenge, it works for Internal Endpoints and Endpoints
  with IP Filtering!\n\nNote that DNS challenges work for both External and Internal
  Endpoints, which is why the Dashboard will always prompt you to create the corresponding
  record (whereas it’ll only prompt you to create the record required for HTTP verification
  for External Endpoints).\n\n\nAs usual, let us know if you have any questions or feedback!"
