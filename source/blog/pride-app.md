We’re proud to announce our role in the world’s first population health study focused on gay and transgender men and women.
##PRIDE Study
Spearheaded by researchers at the University of California - San Francisco, the LGBTQ-focused study is called PRIDE. Researchers’ ultimate goal is to build the largest LGBTQ health database in history so that medical professionals have the proper tools to address the physical, mental and social issues exclusive to gender and sexual minorities.
For example, [33% of the LGBTQ community are smokers, a rate far higher than the national average.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/tonymerevick/lgbt-communities-spend-an-estimated-79-billion-per-year-on-c#.yezkdYZZY) While scientists speculate this statistic means that more of these community members die from cancer and other smoking-related diseases, there is no official data to back these theories.
Needing a way to gather loads of sensitive information quickly and efficiently, PRIDE leaders reached out to the tech world, and we of course responded with innovation.
##PRIDE App
The first contribution to the UCSF study was ThreadResearch’s iOS app, aptly named PRIDE. Employing the newly-released Apple ResearchKit, the app collects public health data using iPhones.
Prompted to answer questions about their health history and concerns, LGBTQ participants will inform the longer-term PRIDE study, which kicks off in January of 2016.
##Our Role
To ensure this private information remains secure, we’re powering a streamlined HIPAA- and IRB-compliant platform behind the scenes of PRIDE.
Our CEO, Chas Ballew, says, “The UCSF PRIDE study is a great example of the changing face of health tech. Smart phones and cloud-based data collection are just now becoming viable solutions in the tightly regulated health-data world. We’re excited to be pioneers in this fast-growing technology.”
Confident that their private information is protected under our prudent watch, researchers and study participants alike can now move forward into realms of medical advances that have never before been explored. And hopefully the fresh strategies developed by physicians will make a dent if not eradicate issues that have long plagued this misunderstood field of medicine.
