[Ember 2.0 has been released](http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/08/13/ember-2-0-released.html)! Major thanks to Robert ([@rwjblue](https://twitter.com/rwjblue)) and our good friend Matthew ([@mixonic](https://twitter.com/mixonic)) for their blood, sweat, and tears.

How does a major open-source framework approach upgrades? Find out in Robert's talk at the Ember.js NYC meetup last month.
